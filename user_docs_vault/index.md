# About Chiron

Chiron is a data exploration/reporting tool for research data with a strong focus on human-subject/patient data and longitudinal data. It has a built-in web interface that can be used directly, or an API for integrating Chiron features into existing applications.

Chiron is being developed at CCHMC (Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center). Long-term, we are interested in making Chiron open-source. If you are at a different institution and are interested in using Chiron for your data, [contact us](mailto:john.meinken@cchmc.org).

# Using the website

*coming soon*

# Using the data API

The data API is for pulling report data directly into a data analysis environment without having to go to the website every time.

- [[Accessing the data API from R]]
- Accessing the data API from SAS - *coming soon*
- [[Accessing the data API from any environment]]
