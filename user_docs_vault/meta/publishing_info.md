âš¡The full repo containing this is available in my chiron_demo PyCharm project.

Repo Structure
- README for usage instructions
- `user_docs_vault` contains this obsidian vault
	- which can be though of as the source code for the site
- `docs` contains the published HTML site
	- which is the build for the site

This `meta` directory is for things I don't want published.

Site goes to this repo
https://github.com/ri-ds/chiron_user_docs

And ends up here
[Chiron User Docs](https://ri-ds.github.io/chiron_user_docs/)
