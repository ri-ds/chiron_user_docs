# Your data in Chiron

Chiron is currently available for researchers at the following institutions:
- CCHMC (Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center)
- University of Cincinnati through [BHIDS](https://med.uc.edu/depart/bhd) (Biostatistics, Health Informatics and Data Sciences)

Long-term, we are interested in making Chiron open-source. If you are at a different institution and are interested in using Chiron, [contact us](mailto:john.meinken@cchmc.org).

We have developer docs to help with deploying a new instance of Chiron and getting your data loaded: https://cchmc.github.io/is4r-chiron/

Chiron supports multiple, unrelated datasets in a single instance (with their own separate user permissions, data schema, site formatting, etc.). So a second option is to find an existing Chiron instance and add your data as a new dataset.
